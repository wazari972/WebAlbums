<!-- A cmp-field-mapping has a field, one or more columns that it maps to.  
     The column can be from a bean's primary table or any defined secondary 
     table.  If a field is mapped to multiple columns, the column listed first
     is used as the SOURCE for getting the value from the database.  The 
     columns are updated in their order.  A field may also be marked as 
     read-only.  It may also participate in a hierarchial or independent 
     fetch group. If the fetched-with element is not present, the field 
     is assumed to be a member of the default hierarchial fetch group.
