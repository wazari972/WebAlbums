<h2>About WebAlbums </h2>
<div class="text">
  <p>
  WebAlbums is a web-application for managing collections for
  pictures. It's my weekend project since more than four years, and
  currently holds some 4000 photos, 300 tags, 500 albums and 9 themes.

  Photographs are naturally organised into daily albums grouped into
  themes (ie, collections). Then pictures' content is described with
  tags. Tags allows to group, and search for, pictures sharing common
  aspects. Gpx files can also be attached to albums.
